PHP source code demonstrating how to convert and validate data from one format to another. This source code allow converting and validating csv file to json and xml format with provision for other file formats. **It is a challenge undertaken by me and feel the need to share it with people that the code may be of benefit to.**

In this directory is hotels.csv as data source, readme as a guide, welcome.png, and index.php that contain the code

The code is to be executed just like a conventional website as it is provided with a user interface.

The code is to be run with a local or live server, nginx/1.14.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.1 OS was used for test in the development of this application 

The application has been tested with php5.6 and php7.2 with significant success


### SET UP AND USAGE

  - The file index.php and hotels.csv should be copy to the web root directory of a local or online test server

  - Access the file via a browser http:// domain or IP/index.php

  - You should see a welcome page as shown in the image welcome.png

  - Click on JSON to generate json validated data of the hotels.csv and XML for the xml version of the validated data

  - You can customize your output options by selecting if to sort the output data or to do indepth validation of the uri or both

  - The code made provison for generating file in other file format aside JSON or XML which make it flexible for any programmer


### NOTE

  - Ensure the web root directory has full permission like 0755 or 755 to enable the script generate json or xml file in the directory



If there is any issue with testing the code, please let me know.
